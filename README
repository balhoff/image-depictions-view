This view shows images which depict the currently selected class in Protege. So if class "A" is selected, it searches for OWL individuals (the images) which are members of the class "foaf:depicts some A". It uses the IRI of the OWL individual to perform a GET on the Web for the actual image. It will use the reasoner so you can use various means to get the depiction inferred rather than directly asserted.
